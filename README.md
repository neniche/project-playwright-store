## About the Framework
***Playwright with TypeScript*** is an excellent choice due to its ease of use with a straightforward API and built-in features like auto-waiting and advanced debugging tools. It offers comprehensive testing capabilities, including multi-browser support and parallel execution. TypeScript enhances maintainability with static typing, while Playwrightâ€™s active community ensures robust support and frequent updates. Additionally, the use of the ***Page Object Model (POM)*** simplifies test code structure by encapsulating UI interactions in reusable and maintainable components, reducing redundancy and improving readability. Furthermore, integrating ***Allure Report*** provides detailed and visually appealing test reports, making it easier to analyze test results and debug issues. This combination delivers efficient, reliable, and scalable test automation while ensuring better organization and reporting.
